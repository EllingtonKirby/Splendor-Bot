# Splendor-Bot

The aim of this project is to build a bot to find the Nash EQ of a two player game of Splendor.

Splendor is a board game which simulates a renaissance gem trader. In it players take turns stocking and spending gems. 

My girlfriend has ruthlessly beaten me more than ten times in a row in Splendor. It's time to get serious.
